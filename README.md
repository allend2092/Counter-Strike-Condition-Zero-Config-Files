# Counter-Strike-Condition-Zero-Config-Files
My preferred config file for bots in condition zero. 

If they have enough money, all bots will consider buying AWP and Auto-Sniper. 
I created multiple types of Expert skill bots, very hard bots and so forth so their abilities aren't all identical
I added some bot names. Some might be offensive as they include curse words.

While there currently isn't a bot that gives a more challenging experience than playing online, sometimes I like to play counter-strike without interacting with their toxic online community. If I'm looking to goof around, I find this bot file makes to bots more entertaining and believable.
